Minimal Container Runtime
A lightweight Linux container runtime built from first principles.
This project re-implements the core ideas behind Docker using Linux namespaces, cgroups v2, and a minimal root filesystem to clearly demonstrate how containers work internally.

<b>Program Lifecycle</b>
python main.py echo hello
        ↓
main() called
        ↓
run_container(["echo", "hello"]) called
        ↓
fork() splits into parent + child
        ↓
child:  sets CONTAINER_INIT=1
        re-execs itself
        setup_namespaces()
        setup_cgroups()
        setup_rootfs()
        setup_mounts()
        execvp("echo", ["echo", "hello"])  ← runs your command
        "hello" gets printed
        child exits
        ↓
parent: waitpid() unblocks
        run_container() returns
        main() returns
        parent exits
        ↓
       DONE
